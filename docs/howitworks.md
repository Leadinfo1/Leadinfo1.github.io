#How it works

These steps outline the workflow of adding a new prospect to Lime CRM based on a website visit:
-	Go to your LeadInfo account > navigate to Inbox.
-	Here you will find all companies that visited your website, including number of page visits.
-	If you click on a company, the card will show you company & contact details.
-	Click on the company you want to add and click on "Link with Lime CRM”.
-	The screenshot below shows where you can find the link.


-	You arrive in the “Link with Lime CRM” screen, insert information (screenshot above shows the interface). You can choose between two options
-	If the company you want to add already exists in Lime CRM, choose Link to existing company.
-	If you want to create a new company, choose Create new company. The owner could be a responsible co-worker/sales rep.
-	Click on the green Link button, which creates a sync to Lime CRM.
-	After the sync is completed, you have linked a company to Lime CRM via LeadInfo :)

These steps outline the workflow to have a first look at the newly created company from Leadinfo.
-	Open Lime CRM (or refresh the page).
-	Go to the Company tab and search name of the newly added company.
-	You can see all company information (left screenshot) is synched correctly from Leadinfo.
-	If you selected Yes at Synchronise website visits during the installation phase, you will see all website visits in a separate history note (example in right screenshot). The history notes then show the webpages visited and duration on each webpage.
